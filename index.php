					<p><strong>What is Platelet-Rich Plasma or PRP?</strong></p>
					<p>Platelet-Rich Plasma or PRP is derived from the patient’s blood. Processing the patient’s blood specimen in a centrifuge separates the blood components and concentrates the platelets in the plasma. The concentrated platelets found in PRP are rich in growth factors along with bioactive proteins that are vital to initiate and accelerate tissue repair and regeneration. These bioactive proteins increase stem cell production to initiate connective tissue healing, bone regeneration and repair, promote development of new blood vessels, and stimulate the wound healing process.</p>
					<p><strong>What are the potential benefits of treatment?</strong></p>
					<p>Patients may see a significant improvement in symptoms, as well as a remarkable return of function. This may eliminate the need for more aggressive treatments such as long-term medication use or surgery.</p>
					<p><strong>How many PRP therapy treatments are needed?</strong></p>
					<p>While response to the therapy will vary, each patient’s are required 4 sessions. Each sessions is spaced approximately one week apart. There is no limit to the number of treatments a person can have. The risks and side effects do not change with the number of injections.</p>
					<p><strong>How soon can I go back to regular activities?</strong></p>
					<p>PRP therapy helps regenerate tendons and ligaments, but it is not a quick fix. This therapy is stimulating the growth of new tissue, requiring time and rehabilitation. During the treatment process, most people are able to resume normal activities and exercise.</p>

							<p><strong>Hair Loss Enhancement</strong></p>
							<p>PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) for Hair Loss can help you to prevent further hair by stimulating the growth of a thicker hair strand, slowing hair loss while promoting healthier and thicker hair growth.</p>
							<p>PRP for Hair Loss acts like a fertilizer on your hair follicles, which are the seeds you need in order for the hair to grow, it can help to promote health and strength of a thinning hair.</p>
							<p><strong>FACE PRP Treatment</strong></p>
							<p>PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) stimulates your own collagen to grow for total facial rejuvenation rather than individual wrinkle improvement. PRP is used for volumizing faces that are beginning to look drawn, to plump out cheek indentations, soften under eye hollows, improve the skin tone, tightness, and texture.</p>

							<p><strong>Skin Care Range</strong></p>
							<p>All products had been carefully created and chosen to blend all skin types. Individual results may vary.</p>
							<p><strong>MICELLAR WATER</strong></p>
							<p>Originating in France, micellar water gained its name because of the micelles oil molecules in its water-like formula of ingredients. When applied to the skin, these molecules latch onto the dirt, make-up and other impurities sitting on your skin, removing them in an effective and gentle matter. They feel – and look – like a toner, but excel at cleansing the skin, while also leaving it feeling soft and hydrated. There’s no need to rinse after using micellar water, making it a skin-loving version of the traditional face wipe. They’re great for all skin types, too, but particularly those with oily or sensitive complexions as micellar waters efficiently clean the skin without causing irritation.</p>
							<p>HOW DO I USE MICELLAR WATER?</p>
							<p>Simply squirt some of the product onto a make-up remover pad (not tissues – they’re no where near as effective) and gently wipe it across your eye area and face until all make-up is removed. Micellar waters aren’t designed to be rinsed off, however if your skin type requires a deeper clean, follow up with your regular cleanser. Micellar cleansing water can be useful for oily skin and acne.</p>
							<p><strong>INVISIBLE ZINC</strong></p>
							<p>(Tinted/Moisturiser/Sunblock) – for women</p>
							<p>(Moisturiser/Sunblock spf 30+, spf50+) – for men</p>
							<p>THE BENEFITS</p>
							<ol>
								<li>A physical barrier between you and the sun.  Protects against surface UVB and deeper penetrating UVA.</li>
								<li>Uses only one active ingredient-Zinc Oxide- a mineral reflector found in nature to create a physical, reflective veil on the surface of your skin.</li>
								<li>Uses micro-fine Zinc Oxide which although invisible to the naked eye still provides outstanding broad spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays. Broad spectrum offers consistent broad spectrum protection against UV(B) and UV(A) rays.</li>
								<li>Invisible Zinc® means the sun protection of Zinc Oxide without the thick zinc cream look. Zinc Oxide has a long history of use in skin care products and is currently a key ingredient in many baby creams, calamine lotions and skin salves.</li>
								<li>Protection every day, not just at the beach. But for daily use.</li>

							<p><strong>VALENS MARULA OIL</strong></p>
							<p>Marula oil is a natural cold compressed oil indigenous to South Africa and Madagascar. The fruits are handpicked by the tribal women of the Namibian tribe and the oil is extracted from the nut of the Marula fruit. These trees are bio-dynamic and drought resistant and the natural weather conditions of low rainfall and strong sunshine help in giving the perfect Marula produce. This oil is great for the hair and body and is rich in vitamin C, tocotrienol, tocopherol(vitamin E), phenolic compounds, flavonoids, omega fatty acids and amino acids. </p>
							<p>The Various Benefits Of Marula Oil Are:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>Anti-aging</p>
									<p>Marula oil has powerful anti-aging properties to restore the lustre of aging skin and, prevent and repair fine lines and wrinkles. The oleic acid and vitamin E keep the collagen healthy and prevent photo-aging and the anti-inflammatory properties of this oil prevent sagging of the skin of the face and neck. It hydrates the skin cells making them plumper and hence leaves a younger looking.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Antioxidant</p>
									<p>Skin damage due to environmental factors like sun exposure, climate, pollution, harsh and dry weather conditions can be treated with the regular use of Marula oil. It heals by penetrating deep into the layers of the skin leaving long lasting effects. It is anti-inflammatory, non-comedogenic and the omega 6 and omega 9 fats help in fighting and treating scars, blemishes and other skin problems. Even chemotherapy patients can feel the difference in their damaged and lacklustre skins after using this oil. The antibacterial properties of this oil can prevent damage to the skin.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Moisturizer</p>
									<p>This oil, in addition to being loaded with valuable compounds, is perfect for all skin types.It is composed of small molecules that help it in seeping deep into the skin and provide hydration from deep inside. It does not clog pores and hence can be used for oily skin too and massaging this oil on the face and leaving it overnight will leave the skin soft and glowing.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Absorbs Deeply</p>
									<p>This oil does not clog pores as it has smaller molecules which get absorbed by the skin and do not stay on the epidermal layers as in the case of other oils that have bigger molecules that can clog pores and lead to sebum formation. Hence this oil nourishes from deep within.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Non-greasy</p>
									<p>This oil does not leave a trace and since it gets absorbed well into the skin hence it does not spoil clothes or leave the skin and hands dirty and unmanageable.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Night Cream</p>
									<p>Marula oil is an effective night cream and nourishes, replenishes and repairs the skin when left overnight.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Acne</p>
									<p>It is non-comedogenic in nature and prevents breakouts and maintains the pH balance of the body. When used regularly, pure marula oil prevents the production of excess oil so that the breakouts are reduced.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Hair</p>
									<p>This oil is light and non-greasy absorbing well into the hair follicles and providing the nourishment. It leaves the hair satin smooth and can be used as a styling agent and conditioner as well. The hair does not look oily after application and frizzy and damaged hair ca be managed well with the use of marula oil.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Nails</p>
									<p>We can massage this oil into our cuticles as a moisturizer as it gets quickly absorbed by the skin, leaving the hands soft and non-oily. Nail care brands use marula oil in their products for its immense skin care benefits.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Face Primer </p>
									<p>Marula oil can be used as a primer before applying makeup. It helps in protecting the skin from the harmful effects of the synthetics present in cosmetics.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Cosmetic Uses</p>
									<p>You can also add it to your foundations, creams, peel-off masks and cleansers for added benefits.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Hydration</p>
									<p>This oil can restore the lost moisture to the skin. It can hydrate dry skin hence is used in post facial therapies.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Natural</p>
